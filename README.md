# Business-Performance-and-Sales-Analytics-Dashboard #

This project presents an end-to-end Business and Sales Analytics solution built on a multi-year retail dataset. The goal is to uncover actionable insights that help businesses improve profitability, identify loss drivers, optimize discounts, and understand customer behavior using SQL and Power BI.
The dashboard transforms raw sales data into decision-ready visual insights for business stakeholders.
📌 Problem Statement
Retail businesses generate massive sales data but often struggle to answer critical questions such as:
Which regions and product categories drive the most revenue and profit?
Which products are loss-making despite high sales volume?
How do discounts impact overall profit margins?
What are the monthly and yearly sales trends?
Who are the high-value customers contributing most to revenue?
This project answers these questions through structured data analysis and interactive visualization.
🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
SQL Server (SSMS) — Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
Excel — Data inspection and validation
Power BI — Interactive dashboard and visual storytelling
